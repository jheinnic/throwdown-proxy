/**
 * The MerkleCalculator provides a suite of methods that are useful when iterating over or traversing
 * through a MerkleTreeEngine-managed merkle tree.
 *
 * The MerkleTreeEngine implements a mapping between the Merkle tree's logical structure as a complete
 * binary tree with relatively small records at each node, and a compact physical arrangement that seeks
 * to maintain locality of reference and minimize the number of random access offsets required to perform
 * a complete leaf-to-root path traversal without requiring an excessive amount of cache storage during
 * operation.
 *
 * It works by conceptually decomposing complete Merkle trees along layer boundaries spaced at fixed
 * intervals.  The result is a forest, with subtrees of equal height, with each subtree of a given
 * non-leaf layer related to exactly twice as many subtrees in the layer below as there are leaves in
 * its own structure.  The sole exception is made at the root node, which is permitted to utilize a
 * smaller depth than everywhere else such that the original tree's depth minus the root overlay's
 * actual depth is a perfect multiple of the depth use for every other decomposed subtree.
 *
 * A complete binary tree of depth D has (2^D - 1) nodes.  Given an ideal I/O transfer size, R, and output
 * size H for hash digests, we know we can derive a density goal of R/H nodes per I/O.  MerkleTreeEngine's
 * uses largest value for D such that (2^D - 1) <= R/H.  For example, given an I/O transfer unit of 8K and
 * a hash digest size of 256 bits:
 *
 * R / H = ((8192 bytes per transfer * 8 bits per byte) / (256 bits per hash)) = 256 hashes per transfer
 *
 * ...such that...
 *
 * 2^D - 1 <= 256
 * log2(D) <= log2(257)
 *      D ~<= 8
 *
 * Given these sizing parameters, MerkleTreeEngine will map every 8 levels of hashes to a single 8KB write.
 * Imagine further that an instance of such a tree is to allocate storage for 2,000,000 entries.
 *
 * log2(2000000) =~ 20.932 <= 21
 *
 * It is not possible to divide partition 21 into some multiple of 8.  There are ways to split 16 or 24,
 * but not 21.  The storage block closest to root is the sole exception that makes it simpler to follow
 * the convention throughout the remainder of any given Merkle tree.  It does, however, burden
 * MerkleTreeEngine with an obligation to track correlations between physical and conceptual notions of
 * place and partial ordering.  MerkleCalculator exists to hide the implementation details and math behind
 * MerkleTreeEngine's needs to map from the logical to the physical and back again
 * of the math required to map between the logical and physical addressing.  The resulting engine code
 * becomes a little more declarative, allowing its code to be read as descriptions of the calculations
 * it requires without having to describe how those calculation requirements are to be met.
 *
 * Consumers and developers of this API are strongly encouraged to review the terminology that follows.
 * There are cases where the author has found it necessary to use synonymous terms to describe concepts
 * that are likewise similar except for the critically important few ways they are different.  This
 * leads to more concise method names in API design, but creates a necessity to help consumers
 * recognize when they need a glossary to resolve what otherwise should seem ambiguous.
 *
 * === Depth and Width, Level and Span ===
 *
 * The first such example involves these relations:
 * "Depth" is to "Width" as "Level" is to "Span" as "Height" is to "Reach"
 * -- "Depth" refers to the number of steps required by any proof constructed from a given Merkle Tree, and
 *    Width refers to the maximum number of distinct items that can be spoken for using a Merkle Tree of
 *    some "Depth".

 * -- "Height" is used to measure the distance between root and leaf in each block-mapped subtree after
 *    the Merkle tree has been conceptually "split" for the sake of crafting I/O blocks.  Reach is then
 *    used with one of two modifiers to count at the base of each subtree.  Reach is aways defined in the
 *    context of a subtree's root node.
 *    -- "Internal Reach" refers to the number of nodes that are leaves still connected to the contextual
 *       root.
 *    -- "External Reach" refers to the set of root nodes that were previously children of what are now
 *       "leaf" nodes from the "Internal Reach"
 *    -- "Root" further modifies "Internal Reach" and "External Reach" to account for its unique record
 *       count.
 *    -- The only time "Height" is modified is when we talk of "Root Height".
 *
 * -- "Level" uses the number of I/O transfers required along a path from a given leaf to the tree's
 *    Merkle Root.  "Span" is a metric that changes from Level to Level.  It counts the number of subtrees
 *    that were severed across all subtrees at a given layer.
 *
 * === REDO: Depth, Width, Level, Span, Height, and Reach
 *
 * -- Depth is used to plae a
 *
 * === Address, Offset, and Index ===
 *
 * The next set of terms are all ways of identifying a specific record using some measurement of distance.
 *
 * -- Address is used to identify a distinct preImage from the source data set, but does do using the
 *    corresponding location of its initial hash digest relative to the start of the Merkle Tree.  Because
 *    the entire Merkle Tree is not necessarily ever stored all in memory at once, this value is not very
 *    useful for indexed access, but it is often used when forming or updating the membership proof for
 *    an element since its sequence of 0's and 1's will chart out the series of left and and right
 *    traversal steps required to reach targeted digest
 *    -- The Address of a pre-image element and the Offset of its Digest would be the same value, but since
 *       the digests of a Merkle Tree are never really stored in sequential order, we instead use
 *       the term "Address" to defined "that which we cannot have".
 * -- Offset is used to identify an indexed random access into physical storage and is 0-based from the
 *    root node.
 * -- Index provides a Partial Order o
